# users microservice
A microservice for users associated with the Take Out app.

## To Do
 - salt and hash validation in /entities/hashMachine.js

-  do we want different endpoints for editing restricted things? like groups or friends?

 - check the jwt is updated whenever groups, subscription, admin or friends are modified

 - write tests for editing and for getUsers dependent on whos logged in

 - extra endpoints:
    - endpoints to do with friends functionality. Like add / remove friend, accept invitation etc. THIS IS NOT A PRIORITY
